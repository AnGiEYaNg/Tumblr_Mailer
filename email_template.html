    <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>

    <p>
      How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
      my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Look at my most recent posts:

	<ul>
      	<% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
        	 <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].href %>>  <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
     	 <% } %>
 	</ul>
    </p>

      Talk soon,<br>
